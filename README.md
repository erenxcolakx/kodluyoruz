1- Write a function that flattens a list. Its elements can be composed of multiple layered lists (such as [[3],2]) or non-scalar data. Example:

input: [[1,'a',['cat'],2],[[[3]],'dog'],4,5]

output: [1,'a','cat',2,3,'dog',4,5]

2- Write a function that inverts the elements in a given list. If the elements inside the list also contain a list, return their elements as well. For example:

input: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]

output: [[[7, 6, 5], [4, 3], [2, 1]]
